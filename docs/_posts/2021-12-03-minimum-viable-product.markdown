Hello everyone.

We are excited to showcase our first demonstration of our application:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsZOr8O476I" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The application currently has five different fragments:
- Gallery
- Notifications
- Home
- Message
- Settings

The Gallery fragment allows you to view images that you have taken using SkyWrite
The Notifications fragment is not implemented yet but in the future it will display notifications when a user sends to a postcode
The Home fragment is where users can view the messages and take photos
The Message fragment is currently is not fully implemented but users will be able to send a message to a given postcode in the future
The Settings fragment is not implemented but in the future the user can change the settings such as theme and how frequently to update the messages
