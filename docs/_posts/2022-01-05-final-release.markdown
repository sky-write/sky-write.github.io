## User Stories ##
Previously, the following three user stories have been implemented in both the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and the Beta Release:
 
1. As a user, I want to use this app on my Android device.
2. As a user, I want to save pictures of AR messages, so that I can view them later.
3. As a user, I want to see a message 100ft up from the ground.
4. As a user, I want to send AR messages to friends and family, so that I can communicate with them in a unique way.
5. As a user, I want to receive AR messages from friends and family, so that they can communicate with me in a unique way.
6. As a user, I want to change the text size of the app, so that I can easily read any text.

Currently, the following user stories have been implemented in the Beta Release:

1. As a user, I want to be notified when there are new messages sent to my area, so that I can keep up to date with new messages.
2. As a user, I want to be able to change my notification preferences, so that I donâ€™t receive unwanted notifications.
3. As a user, I want to be prompted to send a message at holiday events, such as Easter of New Year, so that I don't forget to send out messages.
4. As a user, I want to have the App read out messages using IBM Watson, so that the app is more accessible to me.
