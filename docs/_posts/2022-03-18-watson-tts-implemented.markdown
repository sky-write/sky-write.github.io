Hi again!

We are excited to announce that we have implemented IBM's Watson Text-To-Speech into SkyWrite!

When you look up to view the messages in the sky, the text-to-speech audio is played. There is a toggle to turn this on and off.

We currently use the Lisa V3 voice to say the messages out loud, but we are considering on implementing different voices and languages. The only downside is that this is less efficient so it is only an optional feature for the future.
