Hello everyone.

We are excited to showcase our Beta Release and second demonstration of our application:

## Sending and Receiving ##

With this release the ability to send and receive messages has been implemented. To receive a message, go to the home fragment where the app will automatically display all banners in your current postcode. To send a message go to the messages fragment where you can select from a list of banners and input the destination postcode. 

This was all made possible through cloud infrastructure hosted by IBM. A database has been set up to store all the banner and message data which the app communicates with through an API. 

## Banners ##

The range of available banners to send has been greatly increased, giving the user more options when it comes to sending a message. These include Merry Christmas, Happy Birthday and Congratulations. This has been covered in greater detail in the previous blog post.

## Settings Menu ##

The setting menu has now been fully implemented. It is now possible to toggle between light and dark mode themes and change the font size which is an important feature for accessability.

## User Stories ##
Previously, the following three user stories have been implemented in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
 
1. As a user, I want to use this app on my Android device.
2. As a user, I want to save pictures of AR messages, so that I can view them later.
3. As a user, I want to see a message 100ft up from the ground.

Currently, the following user stories have been implemented in the Beta Release:

1. As a user, I want to send AR messages to friends and family, so that I can communicate with them in a unique way.
2. As a user, I want to receive AR messages from friends and family, so that they can communicate with me in a unique way.
3. As a user, I want to change the text size of the app, so that I can easily read any text.

Additional user stories:

1. As a user, I want to be notified when there are new messages sent to my area, so that I can keep up to date with new messages.
3. As a user, I want to be able to change my notification preferences, so that I donâ€™t receive unwanted notifications.

## Response from Client ##
> ITS AMAAAAZING!!! It's nothing short of STELLAR. Well done and congratulations!!! If its possible to get some Watson into it (maybe just to read out the messages) that would be epic - and i can really shout about this at IBM.
