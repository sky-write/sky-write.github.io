Hello everyone.

We are excited to showcase our beta release and second demonstration of our application:

## [TODO: describe updates to the app] ##

## User Stories ##
Previously, the following three user stories have been implemented in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
 
1. As a user, I want to use this app on my Android device.
2. As a user, I want to save pictures of AR messages, so that I can view them later.
3. As a user, I want to see a message 100ft up from the ground.

Currently, the following user stories have been implemented in the Beta Release:

1. As a user, I want to send AR messages to friends and family, so that I can communicate with them in a unique way.
2. As a user, I want to receive AR messages from friends and family, so that they can communicate with me in a unique way.
3. [TODO]

Additional user stories:

1. As a user, I want to change the text size of the app, so that I can easily read any text.
3. As a user, I want to be able to change my notification preferences, so that I donâ€™t receive unwanted notifications.
